If you have already [created a calendar account](create-calendar-account.md) and you are the administrator of an official UC Santa Cruz group, you may obtain elevated privileges for administering your group's page(s) on the [Events Calendar](https://calendar.ucsc.edu/).

These privileges include:

- bypassing the "pending" queue when creating an event
- customizing your group's landing page with additional group information (website, social media, etc.)
- adding a banner image for your landing page

### Contact the Web Team

Once you have _created_ and _verified_ your new account, contact **[Jason Chafin](https://campusdirectory.ucsc.edu/cd_detail?uid=jchafin)** on the **C&M Web Team**. He will grant you the proper permissions.

### Wield your new powers

Now that you are a **Group Administrator**, go customize your page!

Access the Events Calendar Dashboard from the home page.

Once in the Dashboard, navigate to **Classifications->Groups** via the left sidebar to access the main **Groups page**.

There is a search box on the Groups page that you can use to find your group.

Click on your group's name and you will enter the **Edit a Group** page. Here you can add a description, a link to your group's website, social media properties, a custom banner image.

### Your custom link

Once you are satisfied with your edits, click the "View Group Landing Page" link at the top right of the page.

Take note of this link URL. This is **_your group page_**. You may include it in correspondence, link to it from your website, etc.
