title: Become a Group Administrator

If you are the administrator of an official UC Santa Cruz group, you may obtain elevated privileges for administering your group's page on the [Events Calendar](https://calendar.ucsc.edu/).

These privileges include:

- bypassing the "pending" queue
- customizing your group's landing page with additional group information (group's website, social media, etc.)
- adding a banner image for your group's landing page

The firs thing to do is ...

### Create an account

If you haven't already done so, the first step is to create an account on the Events Calendar using your @ucsc.edu email account.

You may create a user account and password the old fashioned way. You may also "Login with Google" and select your UCSC account to create an account based on that information.

Once you create an account, you will get an email asking you to verify your new account. _**Please check your email inbox**_.

### Notify the authorities

Once you have created and verified your new account, contact [Jason Chafin](https://campusdirectory.ucsc.edu/cd_detail?uid=jchafin) on the C&M Web Team. He will grant you the proper permissions.

### Wield your new powers

Now that you are a Group Administrator, go customize your page!

Add a description, a link to your group's website, social media properties, a custom banner image.

### Your custom link

Once you are satisfied with your edits, click the "View Group Landing Page" link at the top right of the page.

Take note of this link URL. This is _your group page_. You may include it in correspondence, link to it from your website, etc.
