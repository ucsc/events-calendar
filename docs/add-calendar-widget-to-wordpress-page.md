title: Add a Calendar to a WordPress Page
---

Once you [create an Events Calendar widget](create-events-calendar-widget.md), you'll want to embed it into your site. Many UC Santa Cruz websites use the [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) platform, which employs [block-based content editing](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/wordpress-block-editor/). Follow these instructions for embedding a calendar into your WordPress site.

In your WordPress site's Page or Post editor, use the block editor to add the **Custom HTML** block to the area of your page where you want the Events Calendar widget to show.
